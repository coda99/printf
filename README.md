0x11.C - printf (Group project)

An ALX SE project by a team of two collaborators (Andre Obu, Queen Amukamara)

This is a close clone of the printf function in the C programming language.

We will try as much in our capacity to clone the printf function to function as the original in formatting whatever passed to it as a second parameter.
